# Developing a website for my fictional motorbike rental company named "Rideaway!"
Rideaway Rentals, is my fictional, emerging motorbike rental company. A website is then
developed to showcase our services we provide, which is mainly bike rental. This website
is for people who are looking to rent a bike.

## Features and Features Left to Implement
My website is a single scrolling page with different sections in between. The sections I have
created is the Browse, About Us, and Reviews section. There is still room for improvement, as
I could have implemented more pages to book the individual bikes for instance, but I did not 
have much time to do so. Some of my website's cool features include animations when hovering
on certain things or the redirecting through the nav bar, which brings me to the clicked section
automatically.

## Testing
I have only tested my site via Google Chrome's Developer Tools. Website looks fine when I resized
it accordingly, but goes berserk when the screen size goes below 410px x 514px (vertical). Tested 
on all options, including mid and low tier mobile phones. The website does not seem to be taxing
on resources so I am happy about that.
