# Developing a website for my fictional motorbike rental company named "Rideaway!"

Rideaway Rentals, is my fictional, emerging motorbike rental company. A website is then
developed to showcase our service we provide, which is mainly bike rental. This website
is for people who are looking to rent a motorbike from a trustworthy company, via a 
website.

## Features and Features Left to Implement

My website is a single scrolling page with different sections in between. The sections I have
created is the Browse, About Us, and Reviews section. There is still room for improvement, as
I could have implemented more pages and input types like date etc. to choose the dates to book 
the bikes.

## Testing

I have only tested my site via Google Chrome's Developer Tools. Website looks fine when I resize
it accordingly, but goes berserk when the screen size goes below 410px x 514px.

## Credits and Acknowledgement

I do not own any photos used in the creation of this website. I have placed the link to every asset I have used here in this section.
